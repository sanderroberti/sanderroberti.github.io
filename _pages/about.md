I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Biostatistics Branch and the Radiation Epidemiology Branch of the National Cancer Institute. There I am working on studies of radiation exposure following the Chernobyl nuclear reactor accident and modeling the natural history of thyroid nodules under the mentorship of [Li Cheung](https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/cheung-li) and [Elizabeth Cahoon](https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/cahoon-elizabeth).

Before joining NCI, my PhD work focused on new methods for assessing the risk of developing a second tumor after exposure to therapeutic radiation. These methods, incorporating the radiation dose to every point in the organ at risk of developing such a tumor, are expected to increase the accuracy of risk predictions. Furthermore, they should be able to better discriminate between different radiotherapy treatment plans. Using these methods, I developed an [absolute risk prediction model](https://sanderroberti.shinyapps.io/absoluteBCrisk/) for breast cancer among female survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma. Besides this research project, I was a lecturer for the yearly Basic Medical Statistics course, including lectures as well as computer practicals. Finally, I was involved in other research projects as a statistical consultant.

Prior to my doctoral research I obtained a MSc in Mathematics with a focus on statistics and probability, with a master's thesis in biostatistics.
